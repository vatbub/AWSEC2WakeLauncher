<p>Did you ever find yourself in this situation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You have a server that needs to run on AWS EC2.</li>

    <li>The server does not have that much traffic, but...</li>

    <li>...running the server costs a heck of money.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is where this project comes into play. WakeLauncher is a tomcat webapp that can put your EC2 instance to sleep
    and wake it up once you need it again.</p>
